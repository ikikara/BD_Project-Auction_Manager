## Technologies used:
1. Python
    - [Version 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)
2. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
3. [PgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)
4. Libraries
    - [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)
    - [Psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/)

## To run this project:
After installing PgAdmin, Postman and all libraries:
1. Create a database with name "projBD"<br>

5. Create a folder called "logs" on same folder of the file "Auction.py" with a file called "log_file.log".
6. Finally just run it
```shellscript
[your-disk]:[name-path]> python Auctions.py
```

## Notes important to read:
   - The file "log_file.log" contains some information about the execution of the program (the same information will be printed on the shell)
   - To know how to use all the end-points see the Report, they are all described there
   - Some end-points need a token of authentication<br>
